# Meth_M4th

**Level**: 4  
  
**Description**: The level is 4 not because of it's difficulty but of it's trickiness. Check if there are some unusual variable values given in the challenge which are not supposed to be given in conventional unpadded RSA. Apply some basic Theorems from Number Theory, find the vulnerability, exploit it and get the flag!  
  
**Points**: 45
