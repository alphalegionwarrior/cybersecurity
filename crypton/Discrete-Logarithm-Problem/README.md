# Discrete Logarithm Problem
  
Prerequisites:
1. Mathematical Structures
  

You can read about Discrete Logarithm Problem here in this blog post [https://masterpessimistaa.wordpress.com/2018/01/14/dlp-and-baby-step-giant-step-algorithm/](https://masterpessimistaa.wordpress.com/2018/01/14/dlp-and-baby-step-giant-step-algorithm/) where I have discussed Cyclic Groups, Discrete Logarithm Problem and Baby Step Giant Step Algorithm to minimise the time taken to calculate DLP. You can also watch these nice lecture by Christof Paar on Discrete Logarithm Problem:
1. [DH and DLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeOzBCbwxUo&list=PL6N5qY2nvvJE8X75VkXglSrVhLv1tVcfy&index=13)
