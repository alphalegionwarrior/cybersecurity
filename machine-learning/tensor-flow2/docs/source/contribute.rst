Guidelines

Tests
^^^^^

tf-explain is run against Python 3.6 and 3.7, for Tensorflow beta. We use
`tox <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`_ (available with :code:`pip`) to perform the tests.
All the submitted code should be unit tested (we use `pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`_).

To run all the tests, run :code:`tox` in a terminal.

Code Format
^^^^^^^^^^^

All code is formatted with `Black <https://www.github.com/psf/black>`_ (available with :code:`pip`). When opening your PR,
make sure your code is formatted or Travis will fail. To format your code, simply call :code:`make black`.
