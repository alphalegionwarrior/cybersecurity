## Overview
DeepExploit is **fully automated penetration test tool** linked with **[Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)**.  

DeepExploit identifies the status of all opened ports on the target server and **executes the exploit at pinpoint using Machine Learning**. It's key features are following.  

 * **Efficiently execute exploit**.  
 DeepExploit can **execute exploits at pinpoint** (minimum 1 attempt) using Machine Learning.  
 * **Deep penetration**.  
 If DeepExploit succeeds the exploit to the target server, it further executes the exploit to other internal servers.  
 * **Self-learning**.  
 DeepExploit can learn how to exploitation by itself (uses **Reinforcement Learning**).  
 It is not necessary for humans to prepare learning data.  
 * **Learning time is very fast**.  
 Generally, reinforcement learning takes a lot of time.  
 So, DeepExploit uses **distributed learning by multi agents**.  
 We adopted an advanced machine learning model called **[A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf)**.  

### Abilities of "Deep Exploit".  
 Current DeepExploit's version is a **beta**.  
 But, it can fully automatically execute following actions:  

 * Intelligence gathering.  
 * Threat modeling.  
 * Vulnerability analysis.  
 * Exploitation.  
 * Post-Exploitation.  
 * Reporting.  

### Your benefits.
 By using our DeepExploit, you will benefit from the following.  

 For pentester:  
 (a) They can greatly improve the test efficiency.  
 (b) The more pentester uses DeepExploit, DeepExploit learns how to method of exploitation using machine learning. As a result, accuracy of test can be improve.  

 For Information Security Officer:  
 (c) They can quickly identify vulnerabilities of own servers. As a result, prevent that attackers attack to your servers using vulnerabilities, and protect your reputation by avoiding the negative media coverage after breach.  

 Since attack methods to servers are evolving day by day, there is no guarantee that yesterday's security countermeasures are safety today. It is necessary to quickly find vulnerabilities and take countermeasures. Our DeepExploit will contribute greatly to keep your safety.

### System component.  
![System Component](./img/system_component.png)  

DeepExploit consists of the **machine learning model (A3C)** and **Metasploit**.  
The A3C executes exploit to the target servers via **RPC API**.  

The A3C is developped by Keras and Tensorflow that famous ML framework based on Python. It is used to **self-learn exploit's way** using deep reinforcement learning. The self-learned's result is stored to **learned data that reusable**.  

Metasploit is most famous penetration test tool in the world. It is used to **execute an exploit to the target servers** based on instructions from the A3C.  

#### How to Train?  
![Deep Exploit](./img/overview_deepexploit.png)  

DeepExploit learns how to method of exploitation using advanced machine learning model called A3C.  

The A3C consists of **multiple neural networks**.  
The neural networks takes the information of the training server gathered in Step1 as input and outputs some kinds of **Payload**. And the A3C uses the **output Payload to Exploit to the training server** via Metasploit. In accordance with the result (success / failure) of Exploit, the A3C **updates the weight of the neural network** (parameter related to attack accuracy). By performing the above processing (learning) with a combination of various inputs, an optimum Payload for input information is gradually output.  
In order to shorten the learning time, we execute this processing in **multi threads**.  

Therefore, **learning by using various training servers**, DeepExploit can execute accurate exploit according to various situations.  
So, DeepExploit uses training servers such as metasploitable3, metasploitable2, owaspbwa for learning.  

 * ex) Training servers  
 [metasploitable2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/)  
 [metasploitable3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3)

### Step 1. Intelligence Gathering.

#### Port scan
DeepExploit gathers targetting server's information such as **OS type**, **Opened port**, **Product name**, **Product version** using [Nmap](https://nmap.org/).  
After executing Nmap, it extracts above information from following Nmap result.  

 * ex) The result of Nmap.  
 ```
 <port protocol="tcp" portid="21"><state state="open" reason="syn-ack" reason_ttl="0"/><service name="ftp" product="vsftpd" version="2.3.4" ostype="Unix" method="probed" conf="10"><cpe>cpe:/a:vsftpd:vsftpd:2.3.4</cpe></service><script id="ftp-anon" output="Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)"/><script id="ftp-syst" output="&#xa;  STAT: &#xa;FTP server status:&#xa;     Connected to 192.168.220.150&#xa;     Logged in as ftp&#xa;     TYPE: ASCII&#xa;     No session bandwidth limit&#xa;     Session timeout in seconds is 300&#xa;     Control connection is plain text&#xa;     Data connections will be plain text&#xa;     vsFTPd 2.3.4 - secure, fast, stable&#xa;End of status"><elem key="STAT">&#xa;FTP server status:&#xa;     Connected to 192.168.220.150&#xa;     Logged in as ftp&#xa;     TYPE: ASCII&#xa;     No session bandwidth limit&#xa;     Session timeout in seconds is 300&#xa;     Control connection is plain text&#xa;     Data connections will be plain text&#xa;     vsFTPd 2.3.4 - secure, fast, stable&#xa;End of status</elem>

 </osmatch>
 ```

#### Crawling on the Web Port
Next, DeepExploit crawls on the Web Port to find a product that is difficult to detect by port scanning.  
And, DeepExploit can detect several Web products such as CMS and Language.  

DeepExploit gathers the target server information using above two ways.  
The following is example that gathered target server information.  

| Idx | OS    | Port# | product | version |
|:---:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 1   | Linux | 21    | vsftpd  | 2.3.4   |
| 2   | Linux | 22    | ssh     | 4.7p1   |
| 3   | Linux | 23    | telnet  | -       |
| 4   | Linux | 25    | postfix | -       |
| 5   | Linux | 53    | bind    | 9.4.2   |
| 6   | Linux | 5900  | vnc     | 3.3     |
| 7   | Linux | 6667  | irc     | -       |
| 8   | Linux | 8180  | tomcat  | -       |
| 9   | Linux | 8180  | apache  | 2.2.8   |
| 10  | Linux | 8180  | php     | 5.5.38  |

### Step 2. Exploitation.  
DeepExploit execute exploit to the first target server **using learned result**.  
It can execute exploits at **pinpoint** (minimum 1 attempt).  

If the exploitation succeeds, **open session** between Deep Exploit and target server. 

### Step 3. Post-Exploitation.  
DeepExploit executes **exploit to the internal servers** with the first target server as a springboard using opened session.  

### Step 4. Generate report.  
DeepExploit generates a report that **summarizes vulnerabilities**.  
Report's style is html.  

 * ex) Report.
