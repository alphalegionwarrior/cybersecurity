NOTES: 
  *  Files like this in /current/down and named in any of these formats
     must follow these guidelines (and this sample file can be used exactly
     as is, the original simply does a "w" three times):
             special.NOPENstringTASK.cfg 
             special.NOPENstring.IP.TASK.cfg 
             special.NOPENstringTASK.cfg 
  *  Be sure to avoid calls to functions or autoscripts that require
     interactivity.

  *  Commands to do in this NOPEN session use the following syntax
     (without the initial # which turns this example into a comment):
         # NOPEN_DO[ NN]: COMMAND
     where NN is the optional number of times to do the command, which
     defaults to one, < 0 is forever. However, if forever is desired,
     it MUST be the final NOPEN_DO line.
  *  Repeat syntax (repeats all commands herein):
         # REPEAT[ NN]: YES
  *  Sleep syntax allows a sleep between repeated blocks of commands when
     used with the REPEAT option (and is ignored unless REPEATing):
         # SLEEP: N
  *  Note that combining these lines is similar to a -holdwindow:
	# REPEAT:YES
	# NOPEN_DO:-w
	# SLEEP:180
  *  The NOPEN_DO -exit or \-burnBURN command must be last, and autorunonce
     ensures that command is done LAST (after any REPEATs are done). 
  *  If REPEAT is used, any -exit or \-burnBURN lines will be done
     only once, after the REPEAT count is exhausted, and ALL valid
     commands below will be repeated that many times. If no count
     is provided, it repeats forever.

All other lines are simply ignored.

Examples follow, commenting with # or removing a letter in "NOPEN_DO" have
the same effect, the line is ignored.



NOPEN_DO 0: echo this should not run

#NOPEN_DO: -ctrl -d
NOPEN_DO: w
#NOPEN_DO: -lss -xm 01-01-2000 /etc
#NOPEN_DO: -gs dfcheck

# If used, -exit, \-burnBURN or any infinite command must be last,
# and only one such can be used.

# To repeat ALL of the above, use REPEAT NN: YES
# where NN is the count of times to repeat, which defaults TO FOREVER.
REPEAT3: YES

# Use SLEEP: N to sleep N seconds between REPEATed commands.
SLEEP: 2

# Use STOPFILE: string to stop infinite repeats once
# /current/tmp/STOPFILE_string exists
STOPFILE: stopfile_sample

# End with an -exit unless you want the window to stay live (and interactive).
#OPEN_DO: -exit
# End with \-burnBURN to actually burn (no scripty burn just BURN).
#OPEN_DO: \-burnBURN

# To do any one command infinitely, use a negative count.
#OPEN_DO -1: w
