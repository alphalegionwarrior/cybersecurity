Usage: -gs wearcup [-h | options]

OPTIONS [defaults]

-w delay     Have cup sleep for this long before firing. ("delay"
             can be in the format: [#h][#m]#[s])                   [3h]
-p           Instead of using fuser to kill, just outright "kill -9"
             this NOPEN server's pid and (if not 1) its parent pid.
             This can be useful if you have no working directory any
             longer and the NOEPN binary is already deleted, but there
             is still something you want done AFTER NOPEN is gone (with
             -C or -A, or both).
-P pidlist   When using -p, also kill -9 these pids. List must be
             comma delimited integers greater than one.
             NOTE:  Use care here, obviously.
-d /dir      Use this directory as the one to wipe and/or the one
             running binaries that need killing.            [NOPEN cwd]
-W           Skip the dir wipe ("rm -rf /dir") step.
-D           Debug mode--build cup.auto but just show it and exit.
-r rmtname   Run cup on target as "name".                         [cup]
-C           Clean some log entries from one or more files. You are
             prompted for the file to clean, and the regexp to egrep -v
             out of it. This works on Solaris 2.6+ syslogd files and
             most any Linux, too.
-t           Used with -C, this uses the "touch -r" command to try to
             preserve the timestamp of the file(s) being cleaned.
             Probably this is not needed--the timestamp is probably
             roughly current, anyway. Note that this will leave a
             current ctime, though.
-A           Run some more commands after cleanup (use -C for egrep -v
             style log cleaning, though). You are prompted for the
             commands to run.
-T file(s)   File names (comma delimited) of binaries in /dir to kill
             with fuser (required when -W is used, since we do not want
             to assume we kill all of /dir/* in that case).
-F file(s)   Full path to target's "fuser" program. Without -F,
             -gs wearcup will verify the usual location will work. Can
             be a comma delimited list of several files to try.
-R           Reset--remove previously set/verified fuser and find it
             again.

NOTE about -C/-A: Keep in mind no one will see any output from these
                  commands as they are done after the RAT is killed.

-gs wearcup builds /current/up/cup.auto according to the chosen
options, shows the final result, then allows user to either abort or
continue and upload/run cup.auto on target as "./rmtname &".

cup.auto will be patterned after the original shell script cup. Cup
stands for "Clean UP" and is most often run on HP, since a running
binary cannot be deleted there.

When run, cup will delete itself and then sleep the desired delay. Once
the sleep expires or is killed, cup then uses either fuser or kill -9
to kill the desired processes, and then wipes the desired files and/or
directories.

-gs wearcup can be run at the beginning of an op. Default sleep time is
three hours. When the op is done, DO NOT BURN NOPEN! Instead, send the
sleep's pid (NOT CUP's pid and NOT NOPEN's pid) a "kill -9". This will
trigger the rest of the commands in the uploaded cup script to execute,
namely killing off the NOPEN server and its children and cleaning and
deleting the directory.
