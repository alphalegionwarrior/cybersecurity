What it does:

    Jackpop is a port redirector, anything that is sent to the port
    you specify will be sent to the target that you specify, as long
    as you are coming from the source that you specify.  It will pick 
    up the port you are using and use that.  This allows for you to 
    reuse the same port if you desire against the same target.  It does
    put the correct TCP header in place, so any bad checksums will be
    lost.

    Network connections are hidden, but processes are not.

Things it doesn't do:

    1.  It has no encryption.  
    2.  The port you use should not already be in LISTEN mode
        - it does not so nice things to your target.  It will 
          try to connect everything up, but will end up reseting you.
    3.  It will use the destination port as the source port.  
    4.  Process is not hidden unless you are under incision.
    5.  Connection is connectionless, so resends are handled by endpoints

Things to do:

    Add encryption;
    Add bulk port redirection;
      - should work for yellow spirit.
     
Usage:

TA="" SA="" TP="" LP="" jackpop

TA=Target address where jackladder can be triggered
SA=Source address, this is your address that you are connected to the internet
TP=Target port where jack resides, port 23, port 25 etc
LP=Listening port, this is where you direct the jackladder scripts to go

Sample run: 

[root@itt jackpop]# TA=murray SA=555.1.2.50 TP=25 LP=5559 ./jackpop
got murray 
got 555.1.2.50 
got 25 
got 5559

ot@itt jackpop]# TA=murray SA=555.1.2.50 TP=25 LP=5559 D=hme0 ./jackpop
got murray 
got 555.1.2.50 
got 25 
got 5559 
got hme0
