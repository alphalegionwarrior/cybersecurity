CUP - a Clean-UP script for HPUX and non-Y2K compliant systems
by Tom B.

HP-UX will not allow a file to be removed if it
is a binary and currently executing. If you try,
you get errno TEXT FILE BUSY.  This could be a
problem for ops since the last thing you'd like
to do is remove nosy (along with other things).

To remove nosy, you have to start something in the
background that will rm it after nosy terminates.
This can be done in at least 2 ways:
  - start an "at" job
  - have nosy start a background shell to rm it

"at" works ok, but if you're not comfortable with
it, here's the 2nd option.

NOTE: "at" will not work on systems that are still
      not Y2K compliant, so "cup" may be your only
      alternative

Starting a background shell is a bit of a problem for
nosy, as it will wait for the process to finish anyway.
That's no good if you need nosy to die first. The
reason why nosy waits is that it's blocking on a read
from the process it just started.  So, cup close its
outputs.

To use:

  upload cup
  chmod +x cup
  cup &


Cup removes itself, and goes to sleep.  It wakes up
after either
  - 3 hours have passed
or
  - the nosy server is killed (with -1 to the client);
    in this case, nosy sends a SIGTERM to its process group;
    cup traps and ignores it, but its sleep is killed

Then, cup kills everything using any of the files in the 
directory $DIR.  Lastly, the $DIR directory is recusively
removed.

If you are using a tmp directory other than /tmp/.X11R6,
you'll have to change the script.
