See usage statement for options and general usage (pclean -help).

Compiles and runs on Solaris 2.5.1 - 2.8 (sparc & x86)

Bugs/warnings:
==============
- pclean itself WILL show up in pacct file, so you should rename it 
  to something that'll blend in 

- pclean MAY append null entries at the end of the pacct file.
  This problem may occur on systems where lots of processes are 
  getting written to the pacct file.
  (When you delete entries, pclean will tell you how to make sure
   there are no null entries.)

- Occasional problems with large pacct files ( > 3500000 entries):
	- numerical listing may cause lseek() errors
	- sometimes deletes the wrong entries
